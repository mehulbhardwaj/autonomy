## üéØ Vision

Autonomy transforms GitHub into an extensible intelligent collaboration platform where configurable AI agents work alongside human team members to plan, prioritize, and coordinate work. The platform supports unlimited agent types - from core planning agents to specialized domain experts - all configurable through simple YAML files. Instead of replacing human judgment, it augments team decision-making with memory-driven insights and automated task coordination.
