# Issue Notes

## Closed Issue #1
Repository bootstrap and monorepo CI setup have been implemented. The repository now includes a working test suite and GitHub Actions pipeline.

## Closed Issue #2
SecretVault now encrypts PATs and validates required GitHub scopes. Authentication CLI commands support login and whoami.

Both features have been tested and integrated into the CLI, so Issues #1 and #2 are fully resolved.

## Closed Issue #3
CLI now includes Slack authentication and extended auth commands (login, logout, status, github, slack). Associated tests verify new functionality.
