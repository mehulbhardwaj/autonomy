# Issue Notes

## Closed Issue #1
Repository bootstrap and monorepo CI setup have been implemented. The repository now includes a working test suite and GitHub Actions pipeline.

## Closed Issue #2
SecretVault now encrypts PATs and validates required GitHub scopes. Authentication CLI commands support login and whoami.

Both features have been tested and integrated into the CLI, so Issues #1 and #2 are fully resolved.
