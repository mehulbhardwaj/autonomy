## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Autonomous MCP provides a structured Generate-Verify loop for AI-assisted software development, helping individual developers and small teams integrate AI agents into their workflow while maintaining code quality and human oversight.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Small development teams and solo developers face:
- **Context switching overhead**: Juggling PM, SDE, and QA roles
- **Inconsistent processes**: Varying approaches to requirements, implementation, and testing
- **Quality control challenges**: Maintaining standards without dedicated QA resources
- **Documentation gaps**: Missing or outdated project documentation

### 1.3 Solution Overview
A Python package that provides specialized AI agent roles (PM, SDE, QA) working in a structured Generate-Verify loop, integrated with GitHub for issue management and workflow orchestration.
